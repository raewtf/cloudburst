# Cloudburst
Real-time weather, on your Playdate! As far as I know, this is one of the first practical implementations of the new-as-of-writing Playdate networking capabilities. I can't guarantee any good-practice code in here, but hopefully this helps you make something globe-trotting of your own!

A full list of credits and dependencies can be found [here](https://rae.wtf/blog/cloudburst-manual#credits).

If you wanna use this app, it's available for download (soon) [here](https://stuffbyrae.itch.io/cloudburst). Or, if you just LOVE command line tools, use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder, and enjoy!
